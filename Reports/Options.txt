1. Gather data on different types of anomalies from the Carrera Bahn and test same models on those datasets with our same models.
2. Implement F2MD and reproduce the results of Joseph Kamel's experiments.(doesn't really have much to do with HTM either, maybe we could tweak the existing LSTM model)
3. Find the best classifier for the Veremi dataset, probably would involve comparing an LSTM classifier trained on raw data vs plausability scores.(this has nothing to do with HTM)
4. Compare an LSTMAutoencoder to HTM on Veremi but we know that they will probably both fail miserably because of the categorical variables
5. Implement tiling to remove the issue of categorical variables somewhat, test that on HTM and LSTMAutoencoder
